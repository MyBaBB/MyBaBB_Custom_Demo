## Visual Appeal

I’ve focused on creating visually appealing interfaces that engage users. This project serves as a demonstration of my capabilities within my portfolio, highlighting my proficiency in building dynamic and visually appealing web experiences using Tailwind CSS,React and will now enhance it as I go along with Javascript Animations and such along with using svg's in Figma combined with Stable-Fusion, Adobe-PhotoShop, and Adobe-Illustrator.
